# Data Validator

This library is crafted for validating array-type input data, making it ideal for validating form submissions 
and similar tasks. 

We've drawn inspiration from a [particular library](https://github.com/pdscopes/php-form-validator),
but due to specific requirements, we couldn't 
integrate it directly. Hence, this package represents a tailored version tailored to suit our specific needs.
